# Flower_Classifier
Deep Neural Network for classifying 102 classes of flowers, using a Resnet 151 pretrained model.

# Quickstart
Open the project either as a Colab Notebook (colab.research.google.com) or locally as a Jupyter Notebook,
then execute it cell by cell.

Number of epochs is set to 100, but the training should be stopped when validation loss does not decrease
after an entire epoch (the train function can be updated to do this automatically). Running each of the 3 training sessions in this manner will result in an accuracy of over 98% on the validation data set.
